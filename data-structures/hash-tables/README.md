# Hash Tables

Also known as hash maps, maps, dictionaries, objects.

Allows you to set/map a key to its value

## Real life examples

## Operations

| Operations | Time Complexity         | Space Complexity      |
|------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Access     | O(1) - constant time    | -                     |
| Search     | O(1) - constant time    | -                     |
| Search     | O(n) - due to collision | -                     |
| Insertion  | O(1) - constant time    | -                     |
| Deletion   | O(1) - constant time    | -                     |
|            |                         |                       |

## Strenghts

- Insertion is constant time
- Deletion is constant time
- Fast access / lookup
- Flexible keys

## Weaknesses

- Hash Collision, As such, good collision resolution is needed
- Unordered
