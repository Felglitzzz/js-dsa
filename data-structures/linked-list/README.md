# Linked List

A linear data structure that consists of nodes where each nodes contain data and a reference/pointer to the next node in the list

## Operations

| Operations | Time Complexity       | Space Complexity      |
|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Access     | - | -                     |
| Search     | -    | -                     |
| Insertion  | O(1) - constant time  | -                     |
| Deletion   | O(1) - constant time  | -                     |
|            |                       |                       |

## Strenghts

- Dynamic size
- Insertion is constant time
- Deletion is constant time


## Weaknesses

- Additional memory for pointers
- Searching is linear time - you have to go through the items to find what you are looking for
