# Stacks

A data structure where item are placed on top of one another. So they are stacked on top of each other, such that you can only  
LIFO - Last in, first out


## Real life examples


## Operations

| Operations | Time Complexity       | Space Complexity      |
|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Push        | o(1)  | -                     |
| Pop         | o(1)  | -                     |
| Peek        | o(1)  | -                     |
| Lookup      | o(n)  | -                     |
|         


## Strenghts

- Fast Operations
- Fast Peek
- Ordered


## Weaknesses

- Slow lookup but then they are not used for lookup or search
